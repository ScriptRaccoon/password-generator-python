# Password generator in Python

This is a simple command line tool, written in Python, to generate passwords. The length and the complexity (1-4) can be adjusted by the user.

It is also possible to pass arguments to the script directly: `python pwg.py 10 4` generates a password of length 10 with the most complexity.
